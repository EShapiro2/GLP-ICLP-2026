\section{Denotational Semantics}\label{appendix:denotational}

The $LP(P)$ transition system allows defining several denotational semantic notions for a program $P$: (1) the \emph{clause semantics} is the set of all outcomes of all proper runs with an initial most-general unit goal (arguments are distinct variables), closely related to the fully-abstract compositional semantics of LP~\citep{gaifman1989fully}; (2) the \emph{atom semantics} is the set of all outcomes of all successful derivations with an initial most-general unit goal; (3) the \emph{ground atom semantics} is the standard model-theoretic semantics, the set of ground instances of the atom semantics over the Herbrand universe of $P$~\citep{lloyd1987foundations}.
