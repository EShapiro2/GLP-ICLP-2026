\section{Conclusion}\label{section:conclusion}

We have presented GLP, a multiagent, concurrent logic programming language designed for implementing grassroots platforms. The key contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{GLP Definition:} We defined GLP as an extension of logic programs with reader/writer variable pairs satisfying the Single-Reader/Single-Writer (SRSW) restriction, providing asynchronous communication through term matching rather than unification.

\item \textbf{Multiagent GLP:} We extended GLP to multiple agents using multiagent transition systems with atomic transactions, defining maGLP with Reduce, Communicate, and Cold-call transactions.

\item \textbf{Grassroots Proof:} We proved that maGLP is grassroots by showing it is a transactions-based protocol with interactive transactions.

\item \textbf{Grassroots Social Graph:} We demonstrated the expressiveness of GLP by implementing the grassroots social graph protocol, which serves as the infrastructure layer for other grassroots platforms.
\end{enumerate}

Companion papers extend this work: \citet{shapiro2026types} develops a moded type system for GLP enabling the typing of interactive partial computations, and \citet{shapiro2026implementing} provides implementation-ready operational semantics with correctness proofs, supporting the Dart/Flutter implementation for smartphone deployment.
