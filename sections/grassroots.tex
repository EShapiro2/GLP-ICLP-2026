\section{Multiagent GLP is Grassroots}\label{sec:grassroots}
%==============================================================================

This section establishes that maGLP is grassroots, following the framework of~\citep{shapiro2023grassrootsBA,shapiro2025atomic}. Formal definitions appear in Appendix~\ref{appendix:grassroots-defs}.

Informally, a protocol defined via atomic transactions is \emph{grassroots} if its transactions are \emph{interactive}: for any group of agents $P$ running within a larger group $P'$, it is always possible for an outsider in $P' \setminus P$ to interact with a member of $P$ in a way that leaves an ``alien trace'' in $P$'s state---a configuration that $P$ could not have produced on its own.

The Cold-call transaction (Definition~\ref{definition:maGLP}) is the fundamental interactive transaction of maGLP. It allows an agent $q$ outside a group $P$ to connect to an agent $p \in P$, establishing a pair of shared variables: a writer held by one agent and its paired reader held by the other. The resulting shared variable constitutes an alien trace in $p$'s state---a reference that could not have arisen from $P$ running alone.

\begin{restatable}[maGLP is Grassroots]{theorem}{thmMaGLPGrassroots}
\label{theorem:maGLP-grassroots}
The maGLP protocol is grassroots.
\end{restatable}

The grassroots property of maGLP extends to applications built on top of it, provided they use the cold-call mechanism.

\begin{definition}[GLP Application, Cold Call]
A \temph{GLP application} is a GLP program $M$ together with the maGLP infrastructure. An application \temph{uses cold calls} if agents can execute the Cold-call transaction to establish communication with previously-disconnected agents.
\end{definition}

\begin{restatable}[GLP Applications Using Cold Calls are Grassroots]{proposition}{propAppGrassroots}
\label{prop:app-grassroots}
Any GLP application that uses cold calls is grassroots.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}[The Grassroots Social Graph is Grassroots]{corollary}{corSocialGraphGrassroots}
\label{corollary:social-graph-grassroots}
The GLP implementation of the grassroots social graph (Section~\ref{sec:social-graph}) is grassroots.
\end{restatable}
