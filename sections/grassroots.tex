\section{Multiagent GLP is Grassroots}\label{sec:grassroots}
%==============================================================================

This section establishes that maGLP is grassroots, following the framework of~\citep{shapiro2023grassrootsBA,shapiro2025atomic}. The full definitions of protocols, projections, transactions-based protocols, and interactive transactions appear in Appendix~\ref{appendix:grassroots-defs}; here we state the key definition and results.

A \emph{protocol} is a family of multiagent transition systems, one for each set of agents $P\subset \Pi$. Informally, a protocol is \emph{oblivious} if any subset of agents can do anything in a larger group that they could do on their own, and \emph{interactive} if agents in a larger group can always eventually interact with outsiders in a way that leaves ``alien traces'' in their local states.

\begin{definition}[Oblivious, Interactive, Grassroots]\label{definition:grassroots}
A protocol $\calF$ is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \temph{oblivious} if for every $\emptyset \subset P \subset P' \subseteq \Pi$,
    $T(P){\uparrow}P'\subseteq T(P')$
    \item \temph{interactive} if for every $\emptyset \subset P \subset P' \subseteq \Pi$ and every configuration $c\in C(P')$ such that $c{/}P\in C(P)$, there is a computation $c\xrightarrow{*} c'$ of $\calF(P')$ for which $c'{/}P\notin C(P)$.
    \item \temph{grassroots} if it is oblivious and interactive.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{restatable}[Transactions-Based Protocols are Oblivious]{proposition}{propOblivious}
\label{proposition:oblivious}
A transactions-based protocol is oblivious.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}[Interactive Transactions Induce Grassroots Protocols]{theorem}{thmInteractiveGrassroots}
\label{theorem:interactive-grassroots}
A protocol over an interactive set of transactions is grassroots.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}[maGLP is Grassroots]{theorem}{thmMaGLPGrassroots}
\label{theorem:maGLP-grassroots}
The maGLP protocol is grassroots.
\end{restatable}

The grassroots property of maGLP extends to applications built on top of it, provided they use the cold-call mechanism.

\begin{definition}[GLP Application, Cold Call]
A \temph{GLP application} is a GLP program $M$ together with the maGLP infrastructure. An application \temph{uses cold calls} if agents can execute the Cold-call transaction to establish communication with previously-disconnected agents.
\end{definition}

\begin{restatable}[GLP Applications Using Cold Calls are Grassroots]{proposition}{propAppGrassroots}
\label{prop:app-grassroots}
Any GLP application that uses cold calls is grassroots.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}[The Grassroots Social Graph is Grassroots]{corollary}{corSocialGraphGrassroots}
\label{corollary:social-graph-grassroots}
The GLP implementation of the grassroots social graph (Section~\ref{sec:social-graph}) is grassroots.
\end{restatable}

Proofs appear in Appendix~\ref{appendix:proofs}.
